The size of character :one byte,
            integer   :four bytes,
            float     :four bytes,
            double    :eight bytes,

Besides, the output shows that no matter what type it is,the size of pointer is eight 
bytes.That is because the size of pointer depends on the system.Due to 64 bits system on this computer,the size of pointer is eight bytes.(8*8bits)
